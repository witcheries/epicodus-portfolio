    <h1>Witcheries' Portfolio Review</h1>

    <img src="Images/italy.jpg">
    <h2>Hi, I'm Katya!</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my code review portfolio. Isn't it beautiful? I'm basically a senior-level developer and designer already. <em>Kidding!</em> Beyond a passing knowledge of the most basic HTML tags left over from dabbling in fannish sites in high school, I have no idea how the internet works. But I want to learn! So here I am.
      <br><br>
      I'm delving into coding because I'm interested in transitioning to the tech sector, with an intended focus on <strong>front-end development</strong> and <strong>UX/UI design</strong>. In my spare time, whatever that is, I enjoy reading, yoga, and drinking rose on patios. I love traveling and exploring new places, eating good food, wine tasting, and shopping. I'm a writer at heart, a freelance editor, and a sucker for good grammar.

      <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
      <p>
      Here are the projects I've worked on so far. They're super polished and professional and <em>in no way amateurish</em>.
      <br>
      <ul><a href="https://github.com/witcheries/hello-world">Hello World</a> - the very first page I built in Epicodus. Ain't she a beaut?!</ul>
      <ul><a href="https://github.com/witcheries/goodbye-world">Goodbye World</A> - Like hello world, only at the end of the line. Mucking about with very basic HTML.</ul>
      <ul><a href="https://github.com/witcheries/my-first-webpage">My First Webpage / My Favorite Things</a> - Further mucking about with HTML, including branches, and delving into CSS. Commits got a little hairy here.</ul>
      <ul><a href="https://github.com/witcheries/new-blog">New Blog</a> - Further mucking about with CSS.</ul>
      <ul><a href="https://github.com/witcheries/persephone">Persephone</a> - Playing with classes and columns through creating a fake website for an imaginary metal band.</ul>
